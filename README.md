# HTML.Editor
<p>This code creates a simple HTML editor with a textarea where you can write your HTML code and a "Run Code" button to preview the output in an iframe below the textarea.</p>

<b>Note</b><br>
The code uses the eval function for expression evaluation, which can be a security risk in some scenarios. It's recommended to use safer alternatives for expression evaluation in production applications.<br>
